      Two music samples will play simultaneously will different rhythms. <br>
      There are two simulations: one with a simple metronome to demonstrate the conflicting rhythm, and one with a full drum beat to show how this can be confusing in more complicated audios such as songs <br>
      Temporal conflict is introduced as the user finds these overlapping rhythms disorienting and distracting.
